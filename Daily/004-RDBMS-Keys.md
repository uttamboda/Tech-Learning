# Today i have learning about RDBMS-Keys :

## 1. Primary Key :
- A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- It does not allow duplicate values.
- It cannot contain NULL values.
- Each table can have only one primary key.

---

## 2. Foreign Key :
- A foreign key is used to link two tables together.
- It refers to the primary key of another table.
- It can contain duplicate values.
- It can contain NULL values.

---

## 3. Candidate Key :
- Candidate keys are the keys that can become a primary key.
- They uniquely identify each record in a table.
- Duplicate values are not allowed.
- A table can have more than one candidate key.

---

## 4. Super Key :
- A super key is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify a record.
- It may contain extra attributes.
- Every candidate key is a super key.
- Duplicate values are not allowed.

---

## 5. Alternate Key :
- An alternate key is a candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key.
- It uniquely identifies records in a table.
- Duplicate values are not allowed.
- A table can have multiple alternate keys.

----

## 6. Composite Key :
- A composite key is made up of two or more columns.
- It uniquely identifies a record using a combination of columns.
- It is used when a single column is not sufficient.
- Duplicate combinations are not allowed.
